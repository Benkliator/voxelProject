# voxelProject

To run this program you will need GLFW, GLM, C++17, STB Image, as well as
OpenGL 3.3

For further development be wary:

TODO:
- [x] Create chunk mesh in a smarter way.
- [x] Break and build blocks.
- [ ] Load chunks dynamically around the player.
- [ ] Don't render non-visible chunks.
- [ ] Seeding system, loading and saving.
